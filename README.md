Septic Cardiomyopathy: Mitochondrial Metabolism and Immune Infiltration Landscape

Background：

Septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) represents a significant cardiovascular complication associated with sepsis, increasingly recognized as a leading cause of mortality in septic patients. This study ventures into the complex interplay between mitochondrial metabolic dysregulation and immune infiltration disorder in the pathogenesis of SCM. Utilizing advanced bioinformatics and drug discovery techniques, we aim to unravel the intricate mechanisms governing mitochondrial and immune functions in SCM and identify potential intervention strategies.

Methods：

Our approach involved comprehensive analysis of Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets (GSE79962, GSE171546, and GSE167363). Techniques such as Limma and Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) were employed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and module genes, accompanied by functional enrichment analysis. Machine learning algorithms including SVM–RFE, LASSO regression, and random forest were leveraged to pinpoint mitochondria-related hub genes crucial for early diagnosis of SCM. A diagnostic nomogram based on six such hub genes was developed. The study further delved into the immunological landscape using ssGSEA and explored gene expression patterns in single-cell dataset UMAP plots. Potential therapeutic compounds were investigated using the Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB), followed by in vivo and in vitro validation of SCM pathogenesis and drug efficacy.

Results：

We identified six pivotal Mitochondria-related DEGs (MitoDEGs). The diagnostic nomogram based on these genes exhibited high reliability and validity. The study also highlighted significant differences in the immunological microenvironment between SCM and control groups. Spearman analysis underscored the association of hub MitoDEGs with immune cell infiltration. Feature plots indicated pronounced expression of upregulated hub genes in specific immune cells. Furthermore, we observed distinct distribution patterns of mitochondria/inflammation-related pathways in SCM versus control groups. Metformin emerged as a promising therapeutic agent, validated for its efficacy in restoring mitochondrial function and alleviating inflammatory response in SCM.
